# Data generator for data with bias

The data generator is being developed as part of a student research project at the DHBW Stuttgart.

The goal is to provide a Jupyter notebook that can be used to generate a data set that contains an adjustable bias. This is to be worked out for two different scenarios and implemented with the help of Python.
